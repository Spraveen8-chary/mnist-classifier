# MNIST Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

![MNIST](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build and train a CNN using the Keras library to recognize hand-written digits from 0 to 9. The project consists of the following components:

- Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a CNN model with multiple layers including Convolutional and Fully Connected layers.
- Compiling and training the model on the training data.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.
- Saving the trained model for future use.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6+ recommended)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras (2.x)
- NumPy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy
